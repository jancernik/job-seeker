A small utility to help me go through some of the many job board websites out there.

No AI/spammy stuff here, just a simple scraper tool that runs on my desktop, checks the sites periodically, and shows me what's new so I can manually decide what's worth applying to.

Helps me save time so I can focus on working on something else :)
